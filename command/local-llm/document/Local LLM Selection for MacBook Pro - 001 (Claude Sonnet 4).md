I'll help you research local LLM options for your MacBook Pro M3 Max. Given your use cases and technical background, here are multiple viable approaches across each category:

## Model Selection

**Top Candidates for Your Use Cases:**

**Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** - Excellent balance of capability and efficiency. Strong reasoning for scoring tasks, good instruction following for cron jobs, and handles structured queries well. Runs smoothly on M3 Max.

**Qwen2.5 7B/14B Instruct** - Outstanding code understanding and reasoning capabilities. The 7B variant is very efficient, while 14B offers better performance for complex evaluations. Particularly strong for technical tasks.

**Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3** - Reliable performer with good reasoning abilities. Less resource-intensive than larger models while maintaining quality output for your scoring and automation needs.

**Llama 3.1 70B Instruct** (if you have 64GB+ RAM) - Significantly more capable for complex reasoning tasks. Consider this for the scoring/evaluation use case if you need higher accuracy.

**CodeLlama 13B Instruct** - Specialized for code-related tasks. Excellent for analyzing coding agent outputs and technical evaluations.

## Model Management Tools

**Ollama** - Most user-friendly option. Simple CLI (`ollama run llama3.1:8b`), automatic model downloading, built-in API server. Great for getting started quickly and integrating with scripts.

**LM Studio** - Excellent GUI with performance monitoring, model comparison features, and easy switching between models. Good for experimentation and finding optimal settings.

**llama.cpp** - Direct control over inference parameters. Compile with Metal support for M3 Max optimization. More technical but offers maximum performance tuning.

**Jan** - Open-source alternative to LM Studio with local-first approach. Good balance of GUI convenience and customization.

## Inference Optimization

**For M3 Max Specific Optimizations:**
- Use GGML/GGUF quantized models (Q4_K_M or Q5_K_M formats for good quality/speed balance)
- Enable Metal GPU acceleration (built into most tools now)
- Consider 16-bit precision models if you have sufficient RAM

**Performance Tools:**
- **vLLM** - High-throughput serving for production workloads
- **Text Generation Inference (TGI)** - Hugging Face's optimized serving solution
- **LocalAI** - OpenAI-compatible API wrapper for local models

## Implementation Recommendations

**For Cron Jobs:** Start with Ollama + smaller models (7B-8B) for reliability and speed. Use the REST API for easy integration.

**For Scoring Tasks:** Consider Qwen2.5 14B or Llama 3.1 8B with structured output formatting. Test both for accuracy on your specific evaluation criteria.

**For MCP Integration:** Llama 3.1 models handle conversation analysis well. The 8B variant should be sufficient for parsing and summarizing agent interactions.

**Suggested Testing Approach:**
1. Install Ollama first (easiest setup)
2. Test Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B on your actual use cases
3. Benchmark performance and accuracy
4. If needed, experiment with larger models or different management tools

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these options, or help you set up a specific testing framework for evaluation?
